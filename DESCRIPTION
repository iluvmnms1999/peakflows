    in analyzing floods and peaks flows for six specific stream gauges in the
    Upper Carson HUC region in the Sierra Nevada. Package functionality allows
    the user to extract and subset data for different minimum peak
    specifications and easily identify peaks representing floods, as well as
    differentiate between minor and major flood classifications when available.
