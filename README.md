## Introduction

The peakflows package is built around data provided from the USGS
website (<https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/>) which contains streamflow
information for several stream gauges in the Sierra Nevadas. The purpose
of the peakflows package is to allow the user to extract and subset data
and easily understand when the discharged streamflow was a flood, major,
or minor.

The peakflows package can be installed directly from the development
version of peakflows from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with the
following code:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("iluvmnms1999/peakflows")
```

The peakflows package can be called using the following code:

``` r
library(peakflows)
```
